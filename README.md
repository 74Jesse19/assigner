# assigner

This application is an assignment tool that enables users to assign files to employees in selected departments. 

Admin users will need to register for an account to access admin privileges. Regular users will have access to the assignment piece
with out having to login. 

Regular users will have the ability to select a department, enter a file number and click the assign button to assign to
the next employee on the list for the department selected. The application will select employees in a round robin fashion to
ensure the files are distributed evenly.

Admin users are able to create departments and add employees to the departments. They will also have the ability to assign files 
just as the reguar users do. Admin users will also be able to view the number of files assigned per employee per day for inventory
control
